# ButtonTransferApp
A simple Android app that uses a REST-ful API. The app allows "amount" transfers between user's created by a Candidate ID.

# MainActivity 

Displays a list of users created by a specific candidate Each user displays the name, email and it's corresponding ID . When you click the start Transfer button it brings you to a screen that allows you to Transfer amounts between user's. User's information (ID and Name) is passed to the Transfer Detail activity. This page also has a add user button , when clicked it opens to add allows you to enter infroamtion and add a new contact.

# Add a new user

You can add a new user by entering the new user information. Once the "Add" button is clicked it will take you back to the List of user's with the updated list.

# Future Changes


#### For future changes, I would like to : 
        * Improve user experience and flow of the App.
        * To display the last transactions for the current user and add a swipe to delete user feature for each card.
        * Display the negative amount in each transaction in red and the rest in green.
        * Show the total amount in the current user's account.
        
        
# Reflection

I took time to understand how to use the API and how to get the results that were asked. I did my best to implement all endpoints and succesfully transfer "amounts" between user's. There are alot of things I want to improve and I'm excited to peer program the rest of the requirements
